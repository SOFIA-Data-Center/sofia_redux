Basic Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To start an interactive reduction, select a set of input files, using
the File menu (**File->Open New Reduction**). This will bring up a file
dialog window (see |ref_open_new|). All files selected will be reduced
together as a single reduction set.

Redux will decide the appropriate reduction steps from the input files,
and load them into the GUI, as in |ref_reduction_steps|.
