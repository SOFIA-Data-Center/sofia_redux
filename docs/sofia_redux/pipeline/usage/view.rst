Display Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Redux GUI displays images for quality analysis and display (QAD)
in the DS9 FITS viewer.  DS9 is a standalone image display
tool with an extensive feature set.  See the SAO DS9 site
(http://ds9.si.edu/) for more usage information.

After each pipeline step completes, Redux may load the produced images
into DS9.  Some display options may be customized directly in DS9;
some commonly used options are accessible from the Redux interface, in the
**Data View** tab (|ref_data_view|).
