Automatic Mode Execution
------------------------

The DPS pipeline infrastructure runs a pipeline on previously-defined
reduction groups as a fully-automatic black box. To do so, it creates an
input manifest (*infiles.txt*) that contains relative paths to the input
files (one per line). The command-line interface to the
pipeline is run as::

    redux_pipe infiles.txt

The command-line interface will read in the specified input files, use
their headers to determine the observation mode, and accordingly
the steps to run and any intermediate files to save. Output files are
written to the current directory, from which the pipeline was called.
After reduction is complete, the script will generate an output manifest
(*outfiles.txt*) containing the relative paths to all output FITS files
generated by the pipeline.

Optionally, in place of a manifest file, file paths to input files may
be directly specified on the command line.  Input files may be raw
FITS files, or may be intermediate products previously produced
by the pipeline.  For example, this command will complete the reduction
for a set of FITS files in the current directory, previously reduced
through the calibration step of the pipeline::

    redux_pipe *CAL*.fits

To customize batch reductions from the command line, the *redux_pipe* interface
accepts a configuration file on the command line.  This file may contain
any subset of the full configuration file, specifying any non-default
parameters for pipeline steps.  An output directory for pipeline products
and the terminal log level may also be set on the command line.

The full set of optional command-line parameters accepted by the *redux_pipe*
interface are::

    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -c CONFIG, --configuration CONFIG
                          Path to Redux configuration file.
    -o OUTDIR, --out OUTDIR
                          Path to output directory.
    -l LOGLEVEL, --loglevel LOGLEVEL
                          Log level.


Manual Mode Execution
---------------------

In manual mode, the pipeline may be run interactively, via a graphical
user interface (GUI) provided by the Redux package.  The GUI is launched by
the command::

    redux

entered at the terminal prompt (|ref_startup|).  The GUI allows
output directory specification, but it may write initial or temporary
files to the current directory, so it is recommended to start the
interface from a location to which the user has write privileges.

From the command line, the *redux* interface accepts an optional config file
(*-c*) or log level specification (*-l*), in the same way the *redux_pipe*
command does.  Any pipeline parameters provided to the interface in a
configuration file will be used to set default values; they will still be
editable from the GUI.
