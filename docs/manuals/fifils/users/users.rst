Introduction
============

The SOFIA Data Center (SDC) is the successor to the SOFIA Science Mission Operations
Center (SMO) in maintaining the FIFI-LS Redux Userâ€™s Manual. The SMO managed the
manual under the document number SOF-US-HBK-OP10-2007, up to revision L. With
SDC as the new maintainer, the document number has changed to SDC-MAN-0001.

The SI Pipeline Users Manual is intended for use by both SDC staff during 
routine data processing and analysis, and also as a reference for General 
Investigators (GIs) and archive users to understand how the data in which they 
are interested was processed. This manual is intended to provide all the needed
information to execute the SI Level 2/3/4 Pipeline, and assess the data quality
of the resulting products. It will also provide a description of the algorithms
used by the pipeline and both the final and intermediate data products.

This manual applies to FIFI-LS Redux version 2.9.0.
