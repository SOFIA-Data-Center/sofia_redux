Introduction
============

This guide describes the reduction algorithms used by and the data produced
by the SOFIA/HAWC+ data reduction pipeline for guest investigators. The
HAWC+ observing modes, for both total intensity and polarimetric observations,
are described in the SOFIA Observer's Handbook, available from the
`Proposing and Observing <https://www.sofia.usra.edu/science/proposing-and-observing>`__
page on the SOFIA website.

This handbook applies to HAWC DRP version 3.0.0.
