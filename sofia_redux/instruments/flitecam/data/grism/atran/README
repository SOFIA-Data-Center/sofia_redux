These files have been down-sampled to 1e6 points each, from
the default ATRAN resolution.  After binning to FLITECAM
resolution, there is no difference between using the full-resolution
files and these smaller ones.

To down-sample a raw ATRAN file in FITS format:
Loop over the files, generate a 1e6 element wavelength array with
the same range as the original, use mc_interpspec to linearly interpolate
onto the new wavelengths.

npts=1e6
files=file_search('atran*fits')
foreach f,files do begin 
   print, f
   a = readfits(f,h)
   w = a[*,0]
   t = a[*,1]
   s = findgen(npts) * (w[-1]-w[0]) / npts + w[0]
   mc_interpspec, w, t, s, st
   writefits, f, [[s], [st]], h
endforeach

In two lines:
npts=1e6 & files=file_search('atran*fits')
foreach f,files do begin print,f & a=readfits(f,h) & w=a[*,0] & t=a[*,1] & s=findgen(npts)*(w[-1]-w[0])/npts+w[0] & mc_interpspec,w,t,s,st & writefits,f,[[s],[st]],h
