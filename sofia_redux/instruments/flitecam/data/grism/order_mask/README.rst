Order masks should be in Spextool format, with flat data in the image
array, if available, and order edges defined in the FITS header.

Note that the default files are included in the source repository of this
package, but not in the sdists and wheels from PyPI or GitHub.
They may be downloaded separately, if desired, from the
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/SOFIA-Data-Center/sofia_redux>`__.
Otherwise, the software will attempt to automatically download and
cache the reference files as needed.
