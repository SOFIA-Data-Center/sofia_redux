Models should be in Spextool format, in directories named for the object modeled.
If more than one model is present, it should contain an date/hour of
applicability, in UT, as YYYYMMDDHH. For example, if a model of Alpha Boo should
be used for all times near 20150129, hour 8, it should be named 
alphaboo_2015012908_*.fits, and placed in a directory named alphaboo.
