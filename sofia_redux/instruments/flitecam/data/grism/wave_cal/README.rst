Wavecals should be in Spextool format, with wavelength calibration data
in the first plane of the image array and spatial calibration data in
the second plane.

Note that the default files are included in the source repository of this
package, but not in the sdists and wheels from PyPI or GitHub.
They may be downloaded separately, if desired, from the
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/SOFIA-Data-Center/sofia_redux>`__.
Otherwise, the software will attempt to automatically download and 
cache the reference files as needed.
