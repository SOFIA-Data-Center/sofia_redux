Models should be in Spextool format, named for the object modeled.
If more than one model is present for an object, it should contain a
date/hour of applicability, in UT, as YYYYMMDDHH. For example, if a model
of Ceres should be used for all times near 20150129, hour 8, it should
be named ceres_2015012908_*.fits.

Note that the default files are included in the source repository of this
package, but not in the sdists and wheels from PyPI or GitHub.
They may be downloaded separately, if desired, from the
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/SOFIA-Data-Center/sofia_redux>`__.
