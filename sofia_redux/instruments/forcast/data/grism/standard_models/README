Models should be in Spextool format, named for the object modeled.
If more than one model is present for an object, it should contain a
date/hour of applicability, in UT, as YYYYMMDDHH. For example, if a model
of Ceres should be used for all times near 20150129, hour 8, it should
be named ceres_2015012908_*.fits.
